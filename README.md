## 📌 Application Description  

**GuardianBandu** is an AI-powered proactive defence system against real-time scams and harassment via phone calls and messages.  

### ⚠ The Problem  
Phone scams and harassment calls are a widespread issue.  
- Existing tools like Truecaller or Airtel spam filters rely heavily on **user reports**.  
- Such systems are **reactive, not preventive**.  
- Dangerous scams—such as impersonation by fraudsters, extortion, or fake government calls—often **bypass detection**, leaving vulnerable groups like students and senior citizens at risk.  

### 💡 Our Solution  
GuardianBandu takes scam prevention **one step further** by proactively analysing calls **in real-time**:  
1. **Automatic Call Recording & Transcription**  
   - Uses **OpenAI Whisper**, supporting 90+ languages, to transcribe incoming unknown calls.  
2. **Real-Time Scam/Harassment Detection**  
   - A custom **fine-tuned BERT-based NLP model** instantly classifies the call content into categories such as:  
     - Extortion  
     - Romance Scam  
     - Tech Support Fraud  
     - Healthcare Scam  
3. **Immediate Alerts & Actions**  
   - Users receive instant actionable alerts to:  
     - Block the number  
     - Report the incident  
     - Save audio/transcript as **legal evidence**  
4. **Emergency Support System**  
   - A one-tap **"Emergency" button** guides victims through a **4-step response plan** to:  
     - Secure themselves  
     - Document the incident  
     - Report to authorities  
     - Seek further protection  

👉 In short, GuardianBandu shifts scam protection from **reactive reporting** to a **real-time intelligent shield**, keeping users safe **before damage occurs**.
